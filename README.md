## What is Uptime Monitoring?

Uptime monitoring is the practice of continuously checking whether websites, APIs, servers, and online services are accessible and functioning correctly. Monitoring tools perform health checks at regular intervals (often every 1–5 minutes) and send alerts when downtime, performance degradation, or errors are detected.

**Key benefits include:**

- **Early detection** of outages before customers notice
- **Performance insights** to identify slow endpoints or degraded services
- **SSL and domain monitoring** to prevent certificate expiration
- **Global availability checks** from multiple geographic locations
- **Incident response automation** through webhooks and integrations

This list is designed for developers, SREs, DevOps engineers, founders, and anyone responsible for maintaining reliable online services.

## Best Practices for Uptime Monitoring

Follow these guidelines to maximize monitoring effectiveness:

- **Monitor critical user journeys**, not just homepage availability—test login flows, checkout processes, and API dependencies
- **Set up redundant alerts** using multiple channels (email + SMS + phone) to avoid notification failures
- **Use multi-region checks** to differentiate between global outages and regional network issues
- **Monitor SSL certificates** at least 30 days before expiration to allow renewal time
- **Track domain expiration dates** to prevent accidental domain loss
- **Configure alert thresholds wisely**—avoid alert fatigue from transient issues while catching real incidents
- **Test your monitoring regularly** by intentionally breaking non-production endpoints to verify alerts work
- **Document runbooks** for common incidents so on-call responders know how to react
- **Review monitoring coverage quarterly** as your infrastructure and services evolve
- **Use status pages** to communicate proactively with customers during incidents
- **Set up heartbeat monitoring** for critical cron jobs and scheduled tasks
- **Monitor third-party dependencies** (payment processors, CDNs, APIs) that could impact your service
- **Establish SLA targets** and use monitoring data to measure compliance
- **Integrate monitoring with incident response** tools like PagerDuty or Opsgenie for automated escalation
- **Analyze downtime trends** to identify patterns and prevent recurring issues
